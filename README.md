# What
A project that turns blocked ads into sol payouts.

## Why

I got the idea for this project after seeing an ad for pie and thinking that payouts on a crypto such as sol would be much more efficient.

I am still experimenting with the exact payout amount per x ads blocked but currently ~250 ads blocked = $0.05
